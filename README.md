### Configuring Prettier sort import plugin

You can further add sorting rules for your monorepo, for example in `.prettierrc` you can add:

```json
    ...
    "importOrder": [
        "<TYPES>",
        ...
        "",
        "<TYPES>^@myproject", //added
        "^@myproject/(.*)$", //added
        "",
        ...
    ],
    ...
```
